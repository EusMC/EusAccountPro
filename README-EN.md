# EusAccountPro

[**`简体中文`**](README.md) **/** [**`English`**](README-EN.md)

## Introduction

When using the Bukkit / Spigot server, the player's account may be hacked (genuine players are no exception). For this reason, we tried to find a solution, and finally found [**`MineSecure`**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/minesecure.699/) in SpigotMC. You can use the **Two Factor Authentication** developed by Google so that player's account will be protected, the plug-in itself is perfect, but the price is high, so we try to make a plug-in similar to **`MineSecure`**, and it is free and open source, as a plug-in used by server managers, and materials studied by plug-in authors

## Language

- 简体中文 √

## Features

- Two Factor Authentication developed by Google
- The administrator can directly control the player's Two Factor Authentication status
- Multiple databases (JsonDB / ymlDB / MySQL / SQLite) can be used for two-step verification data management **(MySQL / SQLite / ymlDB is under development)**
- You can use the similar apps such as `Google Authenticator` or` Authy` to bind two-step verification
- [`config.yml`](/src/main/resources/config.yml) can be customized
